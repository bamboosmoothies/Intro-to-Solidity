        Math in Solidity is pretty straightforward. The following operations are the same as in most programming languages:

    Addition: x + y
    Subtraction: x - y,
    Multiplication: x * y
    Division: x / y
    Modulus / remainder: x % y (for example, 13 % 5 is 3, because if you divide 5 into 13, 3 is the remainder)

Solidity also supports an exponential operator (i.e. "x to the power of y", x^y):
